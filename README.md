Statistical Test and Power of Movie Rating Data

See the assignment_3.pdf for the full report

This report summarises the statistical modelling and analysis results associated with movie ratings of Adventure, 
Comedy and Drama genres. The goal of this report is to check if the rating distributions across the genres are 
statistically similar. The data “movielens” analysed has been taken from dslabs package in R. The study uses Anova 
and Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum Test, together with power and test size computation by simulation. The report results 
in having statistically different rating distributions in the similar to “movielens” simulated data among these 
movie genres. The simulation suggests to use 1500 samples with the original effect size, for the null hypotheses 
to be correctly rejected 90% of the time.
